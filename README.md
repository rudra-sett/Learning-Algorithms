# Learning-Algorithms
This is a repository of every major machine learning algorithm, built from scratch. It's not really for actual utility, but more so for anyone to see some simple sample code to understand how these things work.

Currently, there's obviously only one algorithm, which is the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. I plan to slowly add more, such as logistic regression, k-means, SVM, etc.
